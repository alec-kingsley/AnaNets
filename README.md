# AnaNets
Finds paths of longest words in a grid. Allows user to input a word list (two provided, for English and Spanish), then a grid of letters (with each line separated by slashes), and then searches for any words that can be "drawn" on that grid.

If the user enters a single line, it will simply work to find anagrams.

Example of input aoseu/lbkrc/qlube/oeulc/bipbo:

Grid:\
``aoseu``\
``lbkrc``\
``qlube``\
``oeulc``\
``bipbo``

You can draw the word "ball" with the 'b' in line 2, the 'a' in line 1, the 'l' in line 2, and the 'l' in line 3. The longest word in this net found by this program is "allures"
